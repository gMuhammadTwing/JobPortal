                                VeritasKWD is a hiring and opportunity creation marketplace. VeritasKWD Endless Possibilities is a massive and realistic opportunity creation model that calls for multisectoral participation. To be transformative, VeritasKWD ropes in to the extent possible the national government of Kenya, county governments, private companies, private investors, and individuals to be partakers in VeritasKWD opportunity creation.<br />
                                Opportunities are deliberately created. Meaningful opportunity creation is capital intensive hence the need for investors. Opportunity Creation is directly proportional to Investment—intentional investment would create opportunities for all Kenyans. VeritasKWD Endless Possibilities investor model guarantees a full employment rate in Kenya.
